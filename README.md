# EAT-A-BURGER
// This project was created to practice the implementation of CRUD operations in conjunction with express, express-handlebars, and mysql packages.

## Motivation
I found handlebars and my starting glimpse into software engineering achitecture to be challenging. I wanted to cement my understanding of these concepts as well as insure I truly understand call-back functions.
